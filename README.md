My Projects
-----------------
Here you can find my web apps I have made with JavaScript and web technologies, etc...

Right now there are only two things, LoL Reader and Media Sync.

* [LoL Reader](http://1lann.github.io/lolreader) is a League of Legends log file reader to generate statistics about yourself.
* [Media Sync (WIP)](http://1lann.github.io/media-sync) is a service which allows you to listen to (mainly) music with others synchronised. It will support audio files, Soundcloud, and YouTube (The latter 2 of which it already supports)
with features such as queues coming soon.
