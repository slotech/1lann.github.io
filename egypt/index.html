		<p id="comparison-paragraph">From the comparison table above, it can be seen that Egypt's population is almost 4 times of 
			Australia, showing how there are much more people the country will need to support. From the lower life expectancy of men and
            women, people living in Egypt are expected to live for shorter than people living in Australia by about 8 years. The more than
            7 times lower GDP per capita shows that people living in Egypt earn significantly less on average than Australians, therefore
            poorer wellbeing. The twice as high birth rate shows a 
			possible lack of birth control by an already not quite economically developed country, meaning the higher birth rate can cause 
			more problems. Strangely, the slightly lower death rate shows that Egypt possibly has better health services. The lower literacy rate shows that 
			people living in Egypt aren't as educated as people living in Australia, with 1 in 4 people in Egypt unable to read and write.
            The lesser doctors per 100,000 show that Egypt has less 
			available medical support than Australia, and the 5 times higher infant mortality rate shows that Egypt has poorer medical support at birth 
			than Australia, showing poorer wellbeing than Australia. Lastly the doubled unemployment rate at youth age shows that jobs aren't as available as in Australia, meaning more 
			people are potentially at poverty due to their unemployment, and in poorer conditions and wellbeing.
			<br><br>
			All of these factors are quantitative factors, most of which measure wellbeing. So from the comparison above, it can be seen 
			that Egypt has poorer wellbeing than Australia, although it can possibly be attributed to the significantly greater population 
			in Egypt, it is one of the causes of the conflicts in Egypt.

		<h3>Factors that have caused this conflict</h3>
		<p>In late 2010 and early 2011, anti-government protests began in a number of Arab countries, starting in Tunisia, a small
		neighbour country of Egypt. These protests, which began being known as the "Arab Spring" were aimed at improving the political
		circumstances and the wellbeing of people living in Arab countries. Seeing this, Egyptians wanted to do the same thing. The
		political reasons that provoked this is that Egyptians wanted their government to be properly democratic, without corruption
		within the government. A combination of other factors were human rights issues and high youth population growth which adds on
		to the current unemployment problems. These issues can be observed in the comparison table above, evident with the high youth
		unemployment rate of 24.8% and high birth rate. Egypt's foreign policy has also caused it to avoid opinions from other countries which
		contributed to this conflict, meaning that the government is closed to other countries, not wanting to follow other countries,
        along with all of the controversey that the United States of America is controlling Egypt, something that the Egyptians
		don't want. The increase of the threat of torture and corruption is what caused people to gather and protest, leading to this
		huge conflict between the people and the government. With the people relying heavily on using social media to organise these
		demonstrations and protests to overthrow the government, and to vote for a new president. This conflict continued as when the
		new president was elected, he took a lot of the power for himself, going against democracy. This caused even larger demonstrations
		and protests of the already fustrated Egyptians.
		<br><br>
		There appeared to be no physical factors contributed to the conflict, apart from the problems caused by the economy.</p>
		<h3>What the issue has lead to</h3>

		</div>
		<p>The issues caused a conflict in which millions of people began to hold mass demonstrations and protests. People who
		stop working to stand in a square to protest. Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt was forced to step down and give power
        to the military, and eventually through democratic voting, a new president, Mohamed Morsi was elected. However this only made
        matters worse, as the Morsi was corrupted himself, granting himself a lot of the power against the democracy people wanted.
        Protests began again, however this time even more people protested, with allegedly 22 million signatures on a
        pention against Morsi. Even worse, the president ordered the military to kill the protesters, which resulted in hundreds of people's
        deaths. Throughout this protest period, some online services 
		were taken down, mainly social media as that was how the protest organisers communicated. At the end of this,
        Morsi was forced to step down by the military and was arrested and charged for the hundreds of deaths he had caused. Egypt was back
        at it's limbo state, with the millions of unhappy protesters without jobs and no coordination from the government. Any definite 
		long-term impacts cannot be observed yet as this conflict is still taking place today.</p>
