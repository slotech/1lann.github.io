		<p id="comparison-paragraph">From the comparison table above, it can be seen that Egypt's population is almost 4 times of 
			Australia, showing how there are much more people the country will need to support. From the lower life expectancy, people 
			living in Egypt are expected to live for shorter than people living in Australia. The lower GDP per capita shows that people 
			living in Egypt earn less on average than Australians, and that the Egyptian economy is weaker. The higher birth rate shows a 
			possible lack of birth control by an already not quite economically developed country, meaning the higher birth rate can cause 
			more problems. Strangely, the lower death rate shows that Egypt possibly has better health services (or the CIA World Factbook 
			is off as other sources suggest that Australia and Egypt have around the same death rate). The lower literacy rate shows that 
			people living in Egypt aren't as educated as people living in Australia. The lower doctors per 100,000 show that Egypt has less 
			available medical support than Australia. The higher infant mortality rate shows that Egypt has poorer medical support at birth 
			than Australia. Lastly the higher unemployment at youth age shows that jobs aren't as available as in Australia, meaning more 
			people are potentially at poverty due to their unemployment, and in poorer conditions.
			<br><br>
			All of these factors are quantitative factors, most of which measure wellbeing. So from the comparison above, it can be seen 
			that Egypt has poorer wellbeing than Australia, although it can possibly be attributed to the significantly greater population 
			in Egypt, it is likely to be one of the causes of the conflicts in Egypt.
