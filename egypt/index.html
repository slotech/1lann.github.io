		<p id="comparison-paragraph">From the comparison table above, it can be seen that Egypt's population is almost 4 times of 
			Australia, showing how there are much more people the country will need to support. From the lower life expectancy of men and
            women, people living in Egypt are expected to live for shorter than people living in Australia by about 8 years. The more than
            7 times lower GDP per capita shows that people living in Egypt earn significantly less on average than Australians, therefore
            poorer wellbeing. The twice as high birth rate shows a 
			possible lack of birth control by an already not quite economically developed country, meaning the higher birth rate can cause 
			more problems. Strangely, the slightly lower death rate shows that Egypt possibly has better health services. The lower literacy rate shows that 
			people living in Egypt aren't as educated as people living in Australia, with 1 in 4 people in Egypt unable to read and write.
            The lesser doctors per 100,000 show that Egypt has less 
			available medical support than Australia, and the 5 times higher infant mortality rate shows that Egypt has poorer medical support at birth 
			than Australia, showing poorer wellbeing than Australia. Lastly the doubled unemployment rate at youth age shows that jobs aren't as available as in Australia, meaning more 
			people are potentially at poverty due to their unemployment, and in poorer conditions and wellbeing.
			<br><br>
			All of these factors are quantitative factors, most of which measure wellbeing. So from the comparison above, it can be seen 
			that Egypt has poorer wellbeing than Australia, although it can possibly be attributed to the significantly greater population 
			in Egypt, it is one of the causes of the conflicts in Egypt.
		</p>
		<h3>Factors that have caused this conflict</h3>
		<p>In late 2010 and early 2011, anti-government protests began in a number of Arab countries, starting in Tunisia, a small
		neighbour country of Egypt seen in the north east of Libya in figure 1. These protests, which began being known as the "Arab Spring" were aimed at improving the political
		circumstances and the wellbeing of people living in Arab countries. Seeing this, Egyptians wanted to do the same thing. The
		political reasons that provoked this is that Egyptians wanted their government to be properly democratic, without corruption
		within the government. A combination of other factors were human rights issues and high youth population growth which adds on
		to the current unemployment and poverty problems. These issues can be observed in the comparison table above, evident with the high youth
		unemployment rate of 24.8% and high birth rate. Egypt's foreign policy has also caused it to avoid opinions from other countries 
		which contributed to this conflict, meaning that the government is closed to other countries, not wanting to follow other 
		countries, along with all of the controversy that the United States of America is controlling like a puppet Egypt. The increase of the threat of torture and corruption is what caused people to gather and protest, leading to this
		huge conflict between the people and the government. With the people relying heavily on using social media to organise these
		demonstrations and protests to overthrow the government, and to vote for a new president. This conflict continued as when the
		new president was elected, he took a lot of the power for himself, going against democracy. This caused even larger demonstrations
		and protests of the already frustrated Egyptians.
		<br><br>
		There appeared to be no physical factors contributed to the conflict.</p>
		<h3>What the issue has lead to</h3>
		<div class="figure-div-right" id="figure2">
			<img src="figures/2.jpg" alt="Millions of protesters fill the streets of Cario">
			<p class="figure-subtitle">Figure 2: Millions of protesters fill the streets of Cario against Mohamed Morsi</p>
		</div>
		<p>These issues caused a conflict in early 2011 where hundreds of thousands of people began to hold mass demonstrations and 
		protests. People who
		stop working to stand in a square to protest. Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt was forced to step down and give power
        to the military, and eventually through democratic voting, a new president, Mohamed Morsi was elected. However this only made
        matters worse, as the Morsi was corrupt himself, granting himself a lot of the power against the democracy people wanted.
        Protests began again in late 2012 and then another mid-2013 with millions of people protesting, and with allegedly 22 million 
		signatures on a
        petition against Morsi. Even worse, the president ordered the military to kill the protesters, which resulted in hundreds of 
		people's deaths. At one point during the conflict, Egypt's entire Internet access was taken down. At the end of this,
        Morsi was evicted by the military and was arrested and charged for the hundreds of deaths he had caused. However some people
		disagreed with the eviction of Morsi which lead to more protests, and ended up with hundreds of more deaths. In total, thousands of
		people were killed due to this conflict. This has also affected people's freedom as there were also curfews and soldiers authorised
		to kill protesters. The conflict continues with bombings intended to kill military personnel and government officials, and it
		ending up killing 6 or so people. It is also evident that buildings were damaged as part of the protests. The conflict is still
		on-going as of today, and because of this, any long-term definite impacts
		cannot be fully observed yet, however it is not apparent that the situation has improved in anyway, with people staying unemployed
		and in poverty, with only a temporary president at the moment.
		<br><br>
		The physical environment did not appear to be affected in any way of significance.</p>
		<h3>What is being done to reduce the impacts of this issue</h3>
		<p>Currently, the United States of America have officially stated that they condemn the actions of the Egyptian government, and
		thus will not support the government in its conflict. There appears to be no external support from any country to help resolve
		the issues and conflicts in Egypt at this stage. The only way this can be resolved is through democratic voting by the citizens
		of Egypt without a corrupt president or government and resolving the wellbeing issues from the government. There is really no
		solution to this as no one is offering to help Egypt in its state it's in. It is afterall in a conflict with itself, and it's
		the government which is corrupted. Egypt is left by itself to solve this conflict and recover from what had happened.</p>
